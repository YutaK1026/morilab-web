Our work centers on 3D grayscale image recognition and 3D binary image processing, including the extraction of fine linear structures, acceleration of image algorithms using GPUs, multi-camera medical calibration, and integration with sensor information. These technologies are applied to surgical navigation and diagnostic support, revolutionizing clinical workflows. Furthermore, we are developing visualization methods for high-dimensional data, aiming to deliver results in forms that can be readily applied in practice."
